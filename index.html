Data Set Information:
<br/>
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, this database  can be used for researh and training purposes. The "Diagnosis" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).
<br/>
The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
<br/>
The data set consist of 1345 observations and 14 attributes. This dataset consists of medical test results and heart disease diagnosis for 1345 individuals.
